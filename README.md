# Latex Files Combiner

Python script for combining multiple TEX files into one text file.

## Dependencies

Its only dependency is the installation of [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## How to use

Call the python script with the your main tex file path relative to the location of the python script:

If the script is a sibling to a the main tex file called `main.tex`, then you can simply call the script using the command `python gencombinedtex.py main.tex`
